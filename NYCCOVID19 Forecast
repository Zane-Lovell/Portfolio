### Forecasting model created by Dr. Jose Luis Guerrero Cusumano
### This model was originally created to forecast COVID 19 cases in Italy
### This model has been formed to NY State the week of March 30
### The data has not been updated since March 31 of 2020

library(readxl)
NYCOVIDForecast <- read_excel("NYCOVIDForecast.xlsx", 
+     col_types = c("date", "numeric", "numeric", 
+         "numeric", "numeric", "numeric"))
plot(NYCOVIDForecast$lncumm, NYCOVIDForecast$`Numeric Pattern`)
### from this plot we can see that the natural log of cumulative COVID19 cases are beginning to level

### we can now fit the natural log to the following equation
### y = a + bx + cx^2
forecastedcases <- -0.296244 + 0.604374*NYCOVIDForecast$`Numeric Pattern_1` - 0.0073519*NYCOVIDForecast$`Numeric Pattern_1` ** 2

plot(NYCOVIDForecast$`Numeric Pattern_1`, forecastedcases)
###this plot shows us the fitted values from our equation which form a smooth parabola. 
### now we must convert back to real number of cases by the following function:
### e^x 
number_e <- 2.71828

realforecast <- number_e ** forecastedcases
plot(NYCOVIDForecast$`Numeric Pattern_1`, realforecast)

###the result of the analysis tells us that NY State should experience the greatest number of daily increases
###around April 12 and should experience some relief from the virus around late may.
